# Final thoughts on the Fire Emblem Draft

## The good:

The smaller unit deployment didn't feel as horrible as I was afraid of, and with most of my units being later recruitments, it led to some very challenging early maps. I also ended up training Est and Delthea, two units I normally don't bother with.

I ended up using fliers and ponies way more than I normally do, because covering a lot of ground with very few units was very crucial to my success. 

I really enjoyed reading about everyone's different experiences. 


## The bad

Leon - even though I pitchforked him into the mercenary line, he couldn't level speed for shit. He was getting doubled everywhere, so I eventually benched him. Genny was also really bad, but she's a healer with Physic, which is all I needed from her. I now realize that both of my armies had no archers at all. Maybe I shouldn't have reclassed him at all...

## The Memories

Mathilda is the MVP of my Alm run - without her so many maps would have been really hard, even with the absolutely cracked Randal that capped spd and skl really early. Turning her into a flier was really smart since her inherent high bulk bases made her survive everything really well. I often sent her off on her own to take care of sections of the map while Delthea and Randal cleared the rest.

Shade and Sonya compete for the MVP spot in my Celica route. Reclassing Shade to a flier was really helpful for a lot of stages, and eventually she became an excellent Sonya delivery tool, since she had a lot of good bulk to survive archers.

Delthea was also heavily invested in and although she has rewarp and someone to deliver her (Mathilda) the fact that she had no bulk made her way harder to use. There were way too many moments where she was on the edge of death, causing my heart rate to climb significantly.

Est was... She died early on and had to be resurrected, which didn't make a good first impression, but after a lot of training she managed to become an okay unit. She was inferior to Shade, Yuzu and Sonya, but better than Leon or Genny. For a trainee unit I found it disappointing. Delthea also gave me a headache, but at least she became a good unit.

Alm and Celica were both good early but their delayed promotions made them start falling off during the mid-game while my powerhouses were ramping up. I started to use them less and less. I did give Alm a bow though, because I thought it would be funny. 

## Key takeaways:

Pegasi are good, rewarp and warp are good, this really is Base Stat emblem. Shade has higher defensive base stats than Est and going through the same level ups as Est, she still had much higher bulk in the end. Same with Mathilda - turns out fliers with high defense and HP are really really really good.

Grinding the items to increase growths to give to Sonya was totally worth it. Bigger number better person and in the end she crit the big dragon boss for 125 dmg, which I thought was really funny.
